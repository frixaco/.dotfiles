To install all dotfiles run:

```
stow -d . -t /home/frixaco/ .`
```

Requirements:

- `Zsh + oh-my-zsh` - best shell
- `Kitty` - best terminal (yes, better than Alacritty)
- `Tmux` - ditched it in favor of Kitty that provides all the functionality that Tmux provides with much better perfofmance
- `Neovim` - best code editor (yes, better than VSCode)
    - `NvChad` - currently used "distro"
    - `LazyVim` - added this to try it out someday
- `Lazygit` - best TUI for working with Git
- `xplr` - good terminal file manager (not sure if it's the best)

- `Yabai` - tiling wm for MacOS
- `skhd` - hotkey manager for MacOS

Additionally:

- `fzf, fd, eza, zoxide, ripgrep, stow`
