To install:

1. `cd frixaco`
2. `stow --adopt --simulate --verbose --no-folding .` (remove `--simulate` flag to actually apply changes)

Requirements:

- `Zsh + oh-my-zsh + powerlevel10k` - best shell (make sure to install plugins)
- `Kitty` - best terminal (yes, better than Alacritty)
- `Neovim` - best code editor (yes, better than VSCode). Finally managed to create my own config, so goodbye and thank you NvChad and LazyVim!
- `Lazygit` - best tool for working with Git
- `xplr` - good terminal file manager (not sure if it's the best)
- `Yabai` - tiling WM for MacOS
- `skhd` - hotkey manager for MacOS

(`tmux` - ditched it in favor of Kitty that provides all the functionality that Tmux provides with much better performance)

Additionally:
- `fzf, fd, eza, zoxide, ripgrep, stow`

TODO:

- [ ] Fully understand how to use `stow`
- [ ] Find a way to automate SSH keys setup
- [ ] Find a way to automate AWS credentials setup
